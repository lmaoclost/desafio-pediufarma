# PediuFarma Challenge

Project for a challenge that has the purpose to make a script that returns a Json for a given Database. I'm using NodeJS because It's a great library for this kind of project and a personal challenge.

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development.

### Prerequisites

Yarn, NodeJS the Database Sample running in your machine - I'm using Docker for this part -, and a text editor. I'm using VSCode. Check the ./src/config/database.js for the Database credentials.

## Installing
cd to the cloned folder
```
$ yarn
$ yarn dev
```
Go to http://localhost:3333 and the project is up and running!
